# Restaurant-Visitor-Forecasting

This is a Restaurant Visitors dataset that was inspired by a Kaggle competition. The data considers daily visitors to four restaurants located in the United States, subject to American holidays. 

The dataset contains 478 days of restaurant data, plus an additional 39 days of holiday data for forecasting purposes.

The data contains an exogenous variable: holiday, which we use to get additional information about the number of people visiting restaurants during particular seasons.
